			"By far the best in town. Archana did a phenomenal job designing my wife's dresses for our engagement party and wedding. She put so much care into every detail that the dresses look great from every angle. We are so happy with the quality that we want her to design several more dresses. Manshaa is the best place in Artesia and at a great price. The other designer studios want to overcharge you for lower quality. Archana is so sweet that she will work with you on every detail and at a very reasonable price.",

			"I don't typically write reviews unless someone or something is exceptional, and Archana auntie is. I love her style, taste, and personality! She blends her passion and knowledge for high end women's fashion, with your own desired look, to come up with perfect combinations for your special day. She also gently encouraged me to try on outfits that I didn't think I would like on the rack, but ended up loving once I wore them. She did this with finesse and in a very non-pushy way, which I appreciated. It was one of the few shopping experiences that I actually enjoyed in my wedding planning process. She literally goes ABOVE and beyond to make her clients look and feel their best. Her designs and attention to details are unbelievable, making every piece of hers unique. She will pour her heart, soul, and time into the outfit you want from start to finish. I was unbelievably thrilled and ecstatic with how my outfits turned out for my wedding festivities! She's creative, attentive, responsive, and dealt with each and every one of my concerns during the design process. I highly recommend working with her and viewing her own collection of Indian outfits.",

			"Wow! My heart is so full...I know it seems strange to start a clothing design review with such emotion but it's true. I first met Archana (the designer) in her shop with a few ideas for a wedding dress design and my colors. In talking to Archana I could tell that she had a considerable amount of expertise, knowledge and most importantly was super personable. The process was very easy and Archana kept me informed through texts and detailed drawings. I went to pick up my wedding dress yesterday and not only was it stunning but the quality of work was impeccable. My mother and I w trying it on. Archana was able to capture my vision and so much more. Archana work is beautiful and I feel so blessed that she allowing me to brought to tears even before display her culture in my wedding. I cannot wait to wear my dress for my husband to be. Our day will certainly be more enhanced because of my dress. Thank you Archana again for an amazing experience. Not only are you an exquisite designer but a beautiful soul. I would highly recommend this shop. P.S. I'm not Indian nor am I marrying an Indian. Signed an extremely happy bride",

			"First off, I owe a big apology to Archana as this review is long overdue! \n \n My mother and I have been patrons of Mansha for almost 7 years. We first met Archana in 2013 when we asked her to design a lace sari for my high school graduation party. She put so much love and care into the piece, to this day it's one of my favorite saris. The blouse piece, adorned with intricate sequins stitch work, is exceptionally beautiful. \n \n Last year she helped me design a sari gown for my cousin's wedding. As a student, my budget was very tight, but she worked with me tirelessly to ensure I could find a suitable fit within my budget. Unlike other designer studios in the area, Archana will never overcharge you or pressure you to make purchases outside of your range. She has an admirable ability to listen and connect with her customers. The sari gown turned out to be so classy, elegant and versatile-- a piece I will cherish for years to come \n \n Recommend Mansha to anyone who is looking for a talented, fair and kind designer. \n Thank you dear Archana for your services.

			"My husband and I got married in private last year. But this summer, we decided to have a backyard wedding for family and friends in Malibu. \n \n Archana was amazing in helping me find the right langa. Her alterations were perfect and she and her staff helped me find just the right jewelry. I'm thrilled with the look that she was able to create for my special day! \n \n My husband also found his sherwani there, with Archana and her father's help. His pagri was beautiful and original. \n \n Both Manshaa locations had everything we needed for our wedding, and everyone was so kind and helpful. \n \n Our guests raved about our attire and kept asking where we got everything. I have a feeling Manshaa will get some new business! \n \n Thank you for making it magical! \n \n",
